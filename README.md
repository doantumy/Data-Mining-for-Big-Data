# Data-Mining-for-Big-Data

The main objective of this project is to achieve scientific analysis on the financial news dataset using machine learning and data mining techniques. We will first analyze the dataset to understand it more and then apply several machine learning algorithms in order to fulfil the classification task which is to predict the labels for the news articles.
